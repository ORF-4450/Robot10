# Robot10
FRC Team 4450 2017 Robot Control program.

This is the 2017 competition robot control program created by the Olympia Robotics Federation (FRC Team 4450).
Operates the robot "Enterprise" for FRC game "FIRST STEAMWorks".

This project requires the RobotLib jar files be downloaded to your WpiLib user library directory located at:
c:\users\yourusername\wpilib\user\java\lib. Download Robot10 and import into Eclipse. Then download RobotLib to
the lib directory and restart Eclipse. RobotLib will be integrated into your Robo10 project. After that, if
RobotLib changes, just download the new RobotLib jars to the lib directory and refresh your Robot10 project.
